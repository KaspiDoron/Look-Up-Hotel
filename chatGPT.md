i want to built a mini project to my repositories collection in my GitHub profile. the project would include vanilla css html javascript. in js i am still a learner so i know only basic dom and eventlisters. the project that i thought about is called "Look Up Hotel". i want to built its main UI page and the functionality behind it. i want it would be perfect fit for mobile devices just like an Airbnb UI. i need from you serval things: first, a png logo, a round one a text long one and some other logos you find that i need (that will include the "look up hotel" company name). the second, is help with the sections that would be in the page, like the hero section, list of hotels based on location and serval more anything you find necessary. the third, is the with the building of the structure of the page, like where each section would be need to be in the page UI, i thought about a navbar in the top of the UI and in the bottom the cart section (that would be like a bottom navbar), let me know any thing you have in mind in that topic. forth and last, i need help with the written content of the page, like the text that would be in each section of the page. also, built for me an illustration of possible 'road site' like where the main page leads, do the page have an about page or maybe a log in page, be wild on the thinking. WRITE ANY THING YOU HAVE IN MIND ON THAT TOPICS.
